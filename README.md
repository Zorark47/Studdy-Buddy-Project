# Studdy-Buddy-Project
This project was created in conjunction with Riley Hartung, Jessica Wen, Andrew Shin, and Alisha Agrawal for CS 3240, Advanced Software Development. 
It was originally hosted on Heroku, but they have discontinued their free plans, so the domain is unfortunately no longer supported.
This website allowed users to create a profile, add all of their classes to their profile, then find other students on the website in those same classes.
They could then chat with other users, contribute to class specific discussion boards, and schedule study sessions. Students could see existing study sessions
for their classes and join them. Study sessions were displayed on the website dashboard.

My largest contribution was the entire study scheduling feature. I also acted as DevOps manager, so I was in charge of GitHub related integrations, as well as
hosting on Heroku.

Created from January through May 2022.
